# Geological Structures Mapping: A CNN Approach

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the project on mapping geological structures using deep learning. This project is part of the coursework for the "Machine Learning for Earth and Environmental Sciences 2023" course, instructed by Professor Tom Beucler. For additional information, please visit: https://wp.unil.ch/dawn/teaching/.

## Contents

This repository contains code related to the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the mapping of geological structures. The primary focus is on leveraging deep learning techniques to enhance our understanding and mapping of geological features.

## Notebooks

The project includes Jupyter notebooks that provide a step-by-step exploration of the implementation and experimentation process. These notebooks cover various aspects of the geological structures mapping project.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the provided notebooks to understand the code and methodology used in this project. Additionally, you can contribute to the project by providing feedback, reporting issues, or submitting pull requests.

### Data

The repository http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4611494 provides access to the images and topographic data as well as the ground truths utilized for training, validation, and testing as `.tif` files (Mattéo et al., 2021).
